# LogViz: a TraceViz demo tool

Have you ever wanted more out of debug logs?  Same here!  Debug logs are great
for debugging issues, but they can also be a useful, if low-bandwidth, channel
for exploring phasic program behavior, and in some circumstances can even help
you understand program latency.  But not if they're just going to sit there
being text files!

LogViz is a rich visualization tool for exploring debug logs, built in the
TraceViz tool-building platform.
